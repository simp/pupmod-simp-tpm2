# @summary Set or clear the authentication passwords for the TPM
#
# At this time you can clear a set password but cannot change it to another value.
#
# This class works when tpm2-tools version 4.0.0 or later is installed.
# You can call this directly but it will not check the version of tpm2-tools
# installed.  It will do nothing if the incorrect version is  installed.
#
# If you don't know what version of tpm2-tools will be installed then
# set tpm2::take_ownership to true in hiera. See the Readme for more information.
# Using tpm2::takeownership will require 2 puppet runs but will allow you to configure
# multiple machines with different tpm2-tools packages.
#
# @param owner
#   The desired state of the owner authentication.
#   Valid setting are set, clear and ignore.
#
# @param endorsement
#   The desired state of the endorsement authentication.
#   Valid setting are set, clear and ignore.
#
# @param lockout
#   The desired state of the lockout authentication.
#   Valid setting are set, clear and ignore.
#
# @param owner_auth
#   The password word for owner authentication.
#
# @param lockout_auth
#   The password word for lockout authentication.
#
# @param endorsement_auth
#   The password word for endorsement authentication.
#
# @example
#
#   See the tpm2::ownership class for examples on setting it up from there.
#
#   To call directly:
#    In your manifest:
#      include tpm2::ownership::changeauth
#    In Hiera:
#      tpm2::take_ownership: false
#      tpm2::ownership::changeauth::owner: 'set'
#
#   The passwords will default to automatically generated passwords using
#   simplib::passgen.  If you want to set them to specific passwords then set
#   them in hiera using the following settings (it expects a minumum password
#   length of 14 charaters):
#
#     tpm2::ownership::changeauth::owner_auth: 'MyOwnerPassword'
#     tpm2::ownership::changeauth::lockout_auth:  'MyLockPassword'
#     tpm2::ownership::changeauth::endorsement_auth: 'MyEndorsePassword'
#
#    See the man page for tpm2_changeauth for more information.
#
#    Note: not all of the command options are currently available through the
#    type.
