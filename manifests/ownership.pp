# @summary Take ownership of a TPM device
#
# This class is called by setting the hiera variable tpm2::take_ownership.  It
# will look at the tpm2 fact and determine if the tpm2-tools package has been
# installed and what version of the tools is installed and attempt to set or
# unset the authentication values for the owners, lockout and endorsement
# contexts.
#
# At this time you can clear a set password but cannot change it to another value.
#
# To use this module, set tpm2::take_ownership to true in hiera
# and set the parameters in hiera to override the defaults.
#
# @param owner
#   The desired state of the owner authentication.
#   If tpm2-tools < 4.0.0 is installed you can not use the
#   'ignore' option. The tool needs all 3 values to work.
#   Puppet will display a warning and not attempt to set
#   auth value if it is used and the earlier version of
#   tpm tools is set.
#
# @param endorsement
#   The desired state of the endorsement authentication.
#   See owner param for more information.
#
# @param lockout
#   The desired state of the lockout authentication.
#   See owner param for more information.
#
# @param owner_auth
#   The password word for owner authentication.
#
# @param lockout_auth
#   The password word for lockout authentication.
#
# @param endorsement_auth
#   The password word for endorsement authentication.
#
# @param in_hex
#   Whether or not the passwords are in Hex.
#   This value is ignore if tpm2_tools package > 4.0.0
#   is installed.
#
# @example
#
#  In Hiera set the following:
#    tpm2::take_ownership: true
#    tpm2::ownership::owner: set
#    tpm2::ownership::lockout:  clear
#    tpm2::ownership::endorsement: set
#
# The passwords will default to automatically generated passwords using simplib::passgen.  If
# you want to set them to specific passwords then set them in hiera using the
# following settings (it expects a minumum password length of 14 charaters):
#
#   tpm2::ownership::owner_auth: 'MyOwnerPassword'
#   tpm2::ownership::lockout_auth:  'MyLockPassword'
#   tpm2::ownership::endorsement_auth: 'MyEndorsePassword'
