- This change updates the tpm2 fact and tpm2::ownership to handle changes in
  tpm2_tools version 4.  The code was updated to provide for the following
  changes in tpm2_tools:
  - tpm2_pcrlist was changed to tpm2_pcrread.
  - tpm2_takeownership was changed to tpm2_changeauth and its parameters
    and functions were changed significantly.
  - tpm2_getcap options were changed and format of the information
    returned was changed.
- The use of tpm2_pcrlist was replaced with tpm2_getcap since it was only used
  to determine if tpm2_tools package was installed.
- The version of the tools installed is derived from tpm2_getcap -v and included as
  part of the tpm2 fact.
- Removed requirement for fact tpm to not exist.  The tpm2 fact will be populated
  if the tpm2 tools are installed and they can talk to the tpm.  If there is a tpm
  fact out there from another module it will not affect this fact.
- Added a provider for the tpm2_changeauth functionality that is equivalant to
  what tpm2_takeownership did.
- Updated tpm2::ownership to check the version of tools installed and call the correct
  type and provider.  The tpm2::*auth parameters will accept a value of 'ignore' if
  tpm2_tools version 4 or later is installed.  Otherwise the parameters for
  tpm2::ownership have not changed.
